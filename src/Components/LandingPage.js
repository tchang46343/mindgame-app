            Motivate The Mind is a mental health game application. Users after
            playing the games should leave with a feeling that promotes
            positivity and clarity in mindset. The game is played by going
            through a series of slides. Each slide is designed in a way to
            increase the stimulation of the user's brain chemical receptor of
            dopamine and serotonin levels. Try out the game, and let us know
            your feedback!
